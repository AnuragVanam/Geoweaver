# Welcome to Geoweaver

2018 ESIP Lab Incubator Project

Geoweaver is a web system to allow users to easily compose and execute full-stack Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) workflows in web browsers by taking advantage of the online spatial data facilities, high-performance computation platforms, and open-source deep learning libraries.

# Project Goals

1) turning large-scale distributed deep network into manageable modernized workflows;

2) boosting higher utilization ratio of the existing cyberinfrastructures by separating scientists from
tedious technical details;

3) enhancing the frequency and accuracy of classified land cover land use maps for agricultural purposes;

4) enabling the tracking of provenance by recording the execution logs in structured tables to evaluate the
quality of the result maps;

5) proof the effectiveness of operationally using large-scale distributed LSTM network in classifying
Landsat image time series.
